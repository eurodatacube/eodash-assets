## Wind V Field at 100m  

ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 8 decades. Data is available from 1940 onwards. 
ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and
consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction
centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to 
produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis 
works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have 
the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the 
ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.

This indicator aims at showing the northward component of the 100 m wind over New Deli City for the year 2023. It is the horizontal speed of air 
moving towards the east, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second [m s-1]. 

**Note**
Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point 
in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box. This parameter can be combined with the northward 
component to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 100 m wind.
