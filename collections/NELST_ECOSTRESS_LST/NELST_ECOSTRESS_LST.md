# ECOSTRESS Land Surface Temperature (NELST)
The NELST (NASA's ECOSTRESS Land Surface Temperature) dataset provides high-resolution measurements of land surface temperature (LST) across diverse global ecosystems. 
It is derived from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) instrument aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 
which measures thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. This dataset is crucial for studying plant-water dynamics, heat stress, and ecosystem health.

## Dataset Description
- Coverage: Global, spanning various biomes and climatic zones. ECOSTRESS provides day and night measurements of surface temperature with high temporal frequency.
- Metric: Land Surface Temperature (LST) data with a spatial resolution of 70 meters.
- Temporal Coverage: Continuous data from 2018 to the present, with multiple passes per day due to the ISS's orbit.
- Data Features: The dataset includes observations in different times of the day to capture diurnal temperature variations, helping to assess evapotranspiration rates and plant-water stress.

Use Case:
Monitoring drought, heat waves, and other extreme weather events.
Estimating evapotranspiration and plant water use, aiding in agricultural and environmental research.
The dataset was developed by [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) under the [ECOSTRESS mission](https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/), providing critical data for studying the interplay between ecosystems and climate.
