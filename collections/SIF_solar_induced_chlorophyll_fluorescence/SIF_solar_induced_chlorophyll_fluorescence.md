## Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence from Sentinel-5p TROPOMI


TROPOMI solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) shows the photosynthetic activity of plant ecosystem.
Plant absorbs sunlight but re-emit a small fraction of energy as SIF, which is strongly related to carbon uptake of CO2 through photosynthesis over plant area (TROPOMI SIF in monthly average [mW/m2/sr/nm]).
