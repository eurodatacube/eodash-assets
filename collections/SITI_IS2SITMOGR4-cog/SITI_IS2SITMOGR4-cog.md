## Monthly Gridded Sea Ice Thickness (ICESat-2 L4)

This data set reports monthly, gridded winter sea ice thickness across the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice thickness is estimated using ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Sea Ice Freeboard (ATL10),
Version 5 data and NASA Eulerian Snow On Sea Ice Model (NESOSIM) snow loading.
