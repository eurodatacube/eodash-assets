## Tanker Ship density Map

This indicator shows maps representing the total tanker ship presence time on a 1 km grid (EEA/Inspire standards)
for every month from 2017-2021. The indicator is provided by the [EMODnet Human activities portal](https://www.emodnet-humanactivities.eu/view-data.php). 

The total tanker ship presence times are converted to average instantaneous number of ships per square km.

These maps have been made from ship reporting data of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), collected by coastal stations and satellites. 

EMODnet Human Activities creates vessel density maps of EU waters showing the average number of vessels of certain type (tanker, passenger, fishing etc.) in a given period within a grid cell.
