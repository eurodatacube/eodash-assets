## Vessel density for tanker

This indicator aims at showing maps representing the total tanker ship presence time on a 1 km grid (EEA/Inspire standards)
for every month from 2017-2021.

The total tanker ship presence times are converted to average instantaneous number of tanker ships per square km.
