# NTLU JAXA Nighttime Light Urban
This dataset, NTLU (Nighttime Light Urban), provides a comprehensive global spatial representation of nighttime light levels in 
**urban areas**. It is derived from satellite observations from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/viirs) sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. This dataset is valuable for studying the distribution of artificial lighting in urban regions, offering insights into urban growth, infrastructure development, and socio-economic activity.

## Dataset description
- The dataset covers urban areas globally, highlighting nighttime light levels to analyze urbanization, energy use, and economic activities.
- Metric: Nighttime radiance values (measured in nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian, nW/cmÂ²/sr), which represent the brightness of artificial lighting in urban areas. From this, the Nighttime Light Intensity (NTLI) can be generated, a composite of observations reflecting the overall intensity of visible nighttime lights in urban landscapes.
- Temporal coverage includes multi-year data, enabling trend analysis in urban growth, infrastructure changes, and energy consumption patterns over time.

The dataset was developed by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) to support global research on urban development, infrastructure expansion, and the socio-economic impacts of urbanization. The data from VIIRS, onboard the Suomi NPP satellite, provides consistent, high-quality nighttime light data for urban regions worldwide.
