#### HOW TO USE THIS TOOL
Selecting the single LAU it is possible to visualize in the "ANALYSIS" box the respective time series of the hourly density of people per square kilometer.

#### WHY THIS DATA
The Dynamic human presence [users / kmÂ²] reports the hourly density of people per square kilometer within each Local Administrative Unit (LAU). A larger value denotes a densely visited area whereas lower values correspond to more sparse (in terms of visitors) areas. Population density allows us to effectively compare the occupation rate of census areas featuring different surface extensions and amount of visitors.
