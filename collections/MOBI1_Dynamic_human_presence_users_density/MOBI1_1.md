The Dynamic human presence [users / kmÂ²] reports the hourly density of people per square kilometer within each Local Administrative Unit (LAU). A larger value denotes a densely visited area whereas lower values correspond to more sparse (in terms of visitors) areas. Population density allows us to effectively compare the occupation rate of census areas featuring different surface extensions and amount of visitors.
