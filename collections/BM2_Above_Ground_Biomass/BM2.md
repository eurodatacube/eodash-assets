## Biomass

Humans have exploited forest biomass as a material and energy source for millennia, but population growth and increasing demand for resources have diminished the extent and condition of forests, including the amount of carbon they store and exchange with the atmosphere.

The [Global Climate Observing System](https://gcos.wmo.int/) considers above-ground biomass (AGB) an Essential Climate Variable due to its functions as both a source of atmospheric CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) when forest is lost under Land Use Change or by degradation, and as a sink for CO2 due to forest growth.

Information on forest biomass can also play a much wider role in understanding and predicting climate, for example in model initialisation, model testing, estimation of carbon turnover, inferring the forest disturbance regime, and data assimilation in carbon cycle and climate models.

The Above Ground Biomass map over Austria is extracted from the European-wide biomass map 2021 from the Forest Carbon Monitoring project. The products rely on ESA's C-band (Sentinel 1A) and JAXA's L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) annual mosaic, with additional information from space borne LIDAR (e.g. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation Lidar GEDI). The combination of these sensor types allows to retrieve information on the amounts of foliage and woody plant material and their distribution, both spatially and vertically, and over time.

|Product Name| FCM 20 m above ground biomass |
| --- | --- |
| Spatial resolution | 20m |
| Temporal reference | 2021 |
| Value range | 0-652 (t/ha) |
| Spatial coverage | Austria (9.5°, 46.3°, 17.2°, 49.0°) |
| Product description | The product provides estimates of above ground biomass (AGB) in t/ha in 20 m spatial resolution. The estimation was conducted with the BIOMASAR approach (Santoro et al. 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112235) developed at Gamma Remote Sensing (https://www.gamma-rs.ch/).  |

| Input datasets | The full list of datasets used for the map creation can be found in the delivery note available here: [Link to be added when available] |
| Reported accuracy | Based on opportunistic sample of NFI plots around Europe (but none in Austria), in full resolution, the product has good agreement for the lower biomass ranges with the tendency of a slight overestimation in the 25-50 t/ha range. Mapped biomass tend to be underestimated beyond 125-150 t/ha and the bias increases with increasing biomass. When aggregated to 10 km x 10 km areas, the estimates become more reliable with the RMSE of 29 t/ha and bias of 12 t/ha.
