## Agricultural production - productive area

Earth Observation can provide timely information for monitoring border closures & transport restrictions and changing food demand on agricultural activities related to food production. 
Satellite observations, such as from Sentinel-2, allow to map the cultivated fields and ongoing activities continuously throughout the harvesting period. 

**Asparagus in Germany**
Harvesting asparagus is a highly labour-intensive activity and involves seasonal workers who typically arrive from Bulgaria and Romania to support the German farmers during the harvest period from March to June.
Sentinel-2 data allow an overview of the cultivated white asparagus fields and related activities.
