## Agricultural production - productive area

This indicator illustrates the production of white asparagus in the German federal state of Brandenburg (29.500 sqkm) in March and April of 2020 compared to the same months in 2019. The indicator is based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 data and shows the impact of the lack of seasonal workers during the Covid-19 pandemic for the white asparagus harvesting, which is a highly labour-intensive activity relying on seasonal workers.
