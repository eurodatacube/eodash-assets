# Arctic Ocean Physics Analysis and Forecast

The operational TOPAZ5 Arctic Ocean system uses the HYCOM model and a 100-member EnKF assimilation scheme. It is run daily to provide 10 days of forecast (average of 10 members) of the 3D physical ocean, including sea ice with the CICEv5.1 model; data assimilation is performed weekly to provide 7 days of analysis (ensemble average).

ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_002_001 is the nominal product of the Arctic Monitoring and
Forecasting Center for ocean physics, and is composed of three-dimensional (3D), daily mean fields of
temperature, salinity, sea surface height, zonal velocity, meridional velocity, vertical velocity, sea ice
concentration, sea ice thickness, sea ice velocity and sea ice type.
