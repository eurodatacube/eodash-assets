#### HOW TO USE THIS TOOL

Visualise the Maximum Land Surface Temperatures for the year 2021 retrieved by Sentinel-3.

Use this tool to visualise the scatterplot of Green roof potential [km^2] in relation to existing Green roofs [km^2] for a selected administrative unit (it currently applies to Zahlsprengel level).


#### WHY THIS DATA

Green Roofs (GR) products are a cutting-edge solution for mapping and quantifying the presence of green roofs on buildings. These products are based on the latest available airborne imagery with a spatial resolution of 20 cm, providing a high degree of detail and precision. Green roofs are an effective measure in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations due to their ability to decrease energy consumption of buildings and sequester carbon within the plants and substrates. Additionally, GRs have been shown to mitigate the effects of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, which is characterized by elevated surface temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings. The quantification of the presence and distribution of GRs through the utilization of Green Roof products is of crucial importance for the assessment of their ability to reduce energy consumption and decrease the carbon footprint of buildings. Furthermore, the ability to map GRs in a given area provides valuable insights into their potential to mitigate UHI effects, thereby contributing to the sustainability of urban environments.

Please note:

In order to detect and calculate the potential of solar and green roofs, the most up-to-date (at the time of the project) Digital Orthophotos (DOP, with a 20 cm spatial resolution) and Digital Surface Models (DOM, with a 1 m spatial resolution) have been provided by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Regions and Water Management (BML) through the Earth Observation Data Centre GmbH (EODC).

The Geoland Basemap Orthophoto which are included in GTIF as a basemap to support visual analysis and qualitative assessment do not correspond to the same date of the arial imaging campaign mentioned above. Due to this lack of temporal correspondence between the aerial imagery, some discrepancies exist which are however not a shortcoming of the methods employed.
