## Monitoring row crops harvesting with SAR data

This dataset illustrates monitoring of row crops harvesting activities by means of [Copernicus Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) 
backscatter and coherence time series for the 2020 season. It is evaluated for winter rapeseed and winter cereals. 
The indicator was produced in the frame of the ESA-funded study “Impact of COVID-19 on Harvest of Row Crops” conducted by [VISTA Remote Sensing in Geosciences GmbH](https://www.vista-geo.de/) that attempted to quantify whether there were any significant delays in harvesting due to COVID-19. The indicator compares the harvest dates observed from Sentinel-1 data to the expected harvest progress simulated with VISTA’s YPSILON® yield prediction service which is based on an advanced physically-based crop growth model that considers natural environmental conditions (e.g., meteorological information), as well as the crop ripening process information from optical Copernicus Sentinel-2 data to estimate an expected harvest date.

A significant delay of the observed harvest to the modelled harvest could indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic had disruptive effects on the agricultural service chain and harvesting measures, but no conclusive statement can be made.
