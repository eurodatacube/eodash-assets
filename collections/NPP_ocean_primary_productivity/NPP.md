## Monthly global Marine Phytoplankton Primary Production

Primary production by marine phytoplankton was modelled using ocean-colour remote sensing products and a spectrally-resolved primary production model that incorporates the
vertical structure of phytoplankton and simulates changes in photosynthesis as a function of irradiance using a two-parameter photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) function
(see Kulk et al. 2020, Sathyendranath et al. 2020a, and references therein for details).
Chlorophyll-a products were obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative ([OC-CCI v4.2 dataset](https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/ocean-colour/news-and-events/news/version-4-2-data-release/)).
Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) products were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and were corrected for inter-sensor bias in products.
In situ datasets of chlorophyll-a profile parameters and P-I parameters were incorporated as described in Kulk et al. (2020).
