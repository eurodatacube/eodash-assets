## TIPS ON USING THIS TOOL
Use this tool to explore site suitability to create new solar farms. You can filter the global horizontal irradiation information depending on topography (elevation, slope and aspect),  distances to the energy grid, presence of protected areas. 


## DATA DESCRIPTION
Global horizontal irradiation (kWh/mÂ²/day) - The greater amount of solar irradiation, the more electricity can be generated by a solar cell module. Selecting area with high solar potential contributes significantly to the desired efficiency and economic feasibility of a solar power project.
Slope & Aspect - Gentle terrain is preferred for solar panel installation. Typical suitability studies choose land with slope of less than 5-15 degrees and with a slope orientation facing in south, southeast, southwest direction (i.e., an aspect in the range of 135-225 degrees).
Elevation - Installation of solar panels in high altitude areas (e.g., 1500 m amsl) can be challenging due to increased transportation cost, suitability of technology, access to the grid, as well as routine and emergency maintenance.
Distance to transmission network - Solar power panels are optimally placed close to the existing transmission network. Reduce this distance to select areas closer to the network.
Protected areas - Solar power facilities are not typically proposed in conservation areas such as Natura 2000 sites and nationally designated areas.
