#### TIPS ON USING THIS TOOL
Use this tool to explore Land Surface Temperature (LST) and its relationship to imperviousness, providing valuable insight for sustainable urban and climate adaptation strategies. You can select an administrative area at Gemeinde level to display a graph showing the relationships between LST and imperviousness (soil sealing), and export the information into a csv file for your further analyses. The graph specifically shows the mean LST for each represented level of imperviousness, from 1% to 100%. The size of the point relates to how much area in the Gemeinde is represented. While this does not include unsealed (0% imperviousness) areas, you can see the mean temperature of the Gemeinde as well as the percentage of the population exposed to temperatures above 30C. 

#### WHY THIS DATA

*LST Composite*

The Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset provides crucial insights into surface temperatures during the summer months. This dataset includes per-pixel estimates of surface temperatures at a spatial resolution of 70 meters. The data is derived from ECOSTRESS observations collected between and predictions were made every third day between June 1st to August 31st. The dataset offers two distinct compositions: Mean LST, which represents the average temperature across multiple observations per pixel, and Max LST, which captures the highest recorded temperatures for each pixel over the same period. This dataset enables detailed analysis of heat patterns and temperature variability, supporting research into climate change impacts and urban heat island effects.

*Imperviousness*

Impervious areas refer to regions where natural surfaces, like soil or water, have been replaced with artificial, non-permeable materials. This transformation can lead to significant environmental issues, such as soil degradation, reduced biodiversity, and increased flooding risks. This dataset indicates the percentage of land covered by artificial materials and was developed using semi-automatic methods on Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite data. This dataset provides per-pixel estimates of impervious cover, ranging from 0 to 100%, at a 70-meter resolution.
