## Methane monitoring

This indicator aims at showing Methane (CH4) concentrations by means of Sentinel-5p [TROPOMI](http://www.tropomi.eu) data.
TROPOMI uses absorption information from the Oxygen-A Band (760nm) and the SWIR spectral range to monitor CH4 levels in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere contributing to the enhancement of the greenhouse effect.

Data from the GOSAT satellite instrument and ground-based TCCON instruments are used for verification and validation.
