## Border crossing points: volume of activity

This indicator shows the increase in traffic jam at the border crossings, as estimated from Sentinel-1 backscatter signal over the highways. 
When there is a large accummulation of trucks, it can be visible from Space. While optical acquisitions were strongly limited due to large presence of clouds in the month of December, the strong signature of the truck loaded roads can be clearly distinguisheable in Sentunel-1 radar imagery.


## The impacts of COVID-19 on border crossing points

The sudden closure severely disrupted the freight routes between the UK and Europe across the Channel by ferry and the Channel Tunnel. The blockade ended after 48 hours of negotiations between French, British and European Union authorities. French frontiers were suddenly closed to all travellers from the UK on December 20 for a 48-hour period, following the announcement by the UK government of a new strain of the Covid-19 virus which it said could be up to [70 percent more contagious](https://www.ft.com/content/40d57a2b-ce51-4000-8526-f366ef4c95e9).

According to Britain’s Road Haulage Association representatives, up to 7,000 lorries were expected to be waiting in the UK to use the crossing, in the coastal county of Kent as well as in depots. Thousands of European truck drivers were reportedly stuck on the English side of the Channel.
