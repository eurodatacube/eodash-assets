# Enhanced Sea Surface Temperature (ENSST) by GCOM-W AMSR JAXA
This dataset, ENSST (Enhanced Sea Surface Temperature), provides global coverage of sea surface temperature (SST) data derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W (Global Change Observation Mission - Water) satellite. It is crucial for analyzing sea surface temperature variations across the globe, which are important for climate research, weather forecasting, and marine ecosystem studies. The dataset offers insights into oceanic conditions, supporting the monitoring of marine environments, weather patterns, and ocean circulation.

The dataset uses color gradients to represent different SST levels; cooler ocean temperatures are shown in darker blue hues, while warmer sea temperatures appear in shades of yellow to red, indicating regions of increased heat such as the tropics or areas impacted by oceanic currents.

## Dataset description
The dataset covers global oceans, focusing on sea surface temperature to support studies in climate change, weather prediction, marine ecosystems, and oceanography.
Metric: Sea surface temperature values (measured in degrees Celsius, Â°C), providing a precise measurement of the thermal state of the ocean surface. The data can be further analyzed for temporal trends in ocean warming and cooling patterns.
Temporal coverage includes long-term, multi-year data, enabling robust analysis of trends in sea surface temperature and oceanic heat content over time.
The dataset was developed by JAXA to contribute to global climate and oceanographic research, providing consistent, high-quality SST data for worldwide use. The AMSR2 sensor onboard the GCOM-W satellite offers reliable microwave-based measurements, which are less affected by cloud cover compared to optical methods, making it ideal for all-weather SST observation.

The dataset is often referenced in climate science and oceanographic research. For instance, Aiko Yamashita (2022) used SST data in the study "Global sea surface temperature trends and the role of ocean currents," presented at the International Oceanography Conference, to examine how ocean currents influence global SST patterns.
