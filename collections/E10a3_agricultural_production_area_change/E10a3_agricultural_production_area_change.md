## Agricultural production - active area fraction


This indicator illustrates the ratio:

(Area_2019-Area_2020)/Area_2019

where Area_2019 and Area_2020 represent the areas cultivated with white asparagus in the German federal state of Brandenburg (29.500 sqkm) in the 2019 and 2020 seasons. The indicator is based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 data and shows the impact of the lack of seasonal workers during the Covid-19 pandemic for the white asparagus harvesting, which is a highly labour-intensive activity relying on seasonal workers.
