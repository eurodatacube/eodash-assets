### Snow Depth

**Product name:** Snow Depth

**Spatial resolution:** 250 x 250 meters

**Temporal reference:** 2017-2022

**CRS:** EPSG:3035

**Coverage:** Alps

**Value range:** 0 - 400 [cm]

**Product description:**

Snow depth (HS) map contains positive values indicating the simulated snow-pack accumulation on the ground. The evolution of the snow-pack is performed with the distributed full energy balance physical model GEOtop ([Endrizzi et al., 2014](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2831/2014/gmd-7-2831-2014.html)) that was modified o assimilate observations and satellite information with the scope of improve the results. This variable has numerous applications, ranging from energy planning for hydropower companies to hydrological balances for public agencies.
