| Product description |Green Roofs (GR) products are a cutting-edge solution for mapping and quantifying the presence of green roofs on buildings. These products are based on the latest available airborne imagery with a spatial resolution of 20 cm, providing a high degree of detail and precision.<br>Green roofs are an effective measure in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations due to their ability to decrease energy consumption of buildings and sequester carbon within the plants and substrates. Additionally, GRs have been shown to mitigate the effects of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, which is characterized by elevated surface temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural surroundings. <br> The quantification of the presence and distribution of GRs through the utilization of Green Roof products is of crucial importance for the assessment of their ability to reduce energy consumption and decrease the carbon footprint of buildings. Furthermore, the ability to map GRs in a given area provides valuable insights into their potential to mitigate UHI effects, thereby contributing to the sustainability of urban environments. In particular, the computed indicators include:<br>Green Roof Impact Score: describes the impact of retrofitting a building with a green roof based on the land surface temperature and the surrounding greenness. This score aims to provide a quantitative assessment of the potential benefits of installing a green roof on a specific building or in a specific area. The GRIMP is calculated by considering the current land surface temperature of a building and the surrounding greenness, which is measured as the vegetation cover in the area. By comparing these values with the estimated land surface temperature and greenness after the installation of a green roof, the GRIS provides an estimate of the potential reduction in temperature and the increase in greenness that can be achieved by retrofitting a building with a green roof.|
