| Product description | The Bifacial Solar Panel Energy Increase Factor estimates the maximum additional energy collected by adding a rear or ground-facing panel to a solar array. Depending on the surface characteristics and the distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth, the ground reflects radiation. The ratio between the ground reflected radiation and the incident radiation is called albedo (α) and takes values ranging from 0 (all the incident radiation is absorbed by the ground) to 1 (all the incident radiation is reflected by the ground). Lighter-coloured surfaces (i.e. snow, ice) present higher albedo than darker-coloured ones (i.e. asphalt, bare soil).<br/>On one hand, albedo can be computed over the entire spectrum of solar radiation or for a specific wavelength or wavelength band. On the other hand, PV solar panels can convert solar radiation into electric current for a certain band range. As an example, a silicon cell usually operates in the range of λPVl=400 to λPVu=1200 nm wavelength. Therefore, to estimate the electric current, the solar cell spectral response curve (shown in Fig. 1) and the solar radiation for the solar cell operation band range are needed. In this case, the Spectral Response considers reference values of a LONGi Solar 26.8% n-type HJT silicon cell, while the Solar Radiation Distribution is the ASTM G-173-03 Reference Spectra Derived from SMARTS v. 2.9.2 AM1.5, which is the Standard model used in middle latitudes.<br/><br/>The maximum total electrical current that the Silicon PV cell can generate is:<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_formula1.png)<br/>for the direct light reaching the cell and,<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_formula2.png)<br/> for the reflected light. Electric current I is measured in A/m²,  in nm, Spectral Response SR in A/W, albedo is a scalar, Solar Irradiance L in W/m².<br/>However, the albedo product has been calculated based on the information provided by Sentinel 2 bands. Therefore, the estimation of the electric current is constrained to the S2 spectral bands covering the operational spectral range of the silicon cell, bn={B2, B3, B4, B8A}. In this way, the maximum electrical current that can be estimated is:<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_formula3.png)<br/> for the direct light and,<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_formula4.png) <br/> where l, u represent the lower and upper wavelength limit for each of the considered bands.<br/> By using a limited range of the full operational spectral range of the PV cell the maximum electric current we can estimate is approximately 23% of the maximum electric current generated:<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_formula5.png)<br/>The Bifacial Solar Panel Energy Increase Factor presented in this layer is the ratio between the electric current generated due to the reflected light and the electric current generated by the direct light:<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_formula6.png)<br/>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/gtif-datainfo/albedo_figure1.png)<br/>Water bodies have been masked from this dataset using high resolution water and wetness layers from the European Environment Agency (EEA). |
