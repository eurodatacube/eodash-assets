| Product description | The distance to transformers is a measure of how close a given point is to the nearest electrical substation (Umspannwerk) capable of connecting to the energy grid. In the case of wind power, a minimum transformer capacity of 36 Kilowatts (36kW) is required. The data were taken from the Open Infrastructure Map, which is a database view of the world´s electricity, telecoms, oil, and gas infrastructure, using data from OpenStreetMap. Distances to the main transformer substations are calculated in meters for every grid cell at 10 x10m resolution.|
