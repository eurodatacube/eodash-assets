### Snow Water Equivalent

**Product name:** Snow Water Equivalent

**Spatial resolution:** 250 x 250 meters

**Temporal reference:** 2017-2022

**CRS:** EPSG:3035

**Coverage:** Alps

**Value range:** 0 - 2000 [mm]

**Product description:**

Snow water equivalent (SWE) represent the depth of water that would result if the snow mass melted completely ([Fierz et al., 2009](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000186462)). The SWE map contains positive values indicating the estimated water equivalent in millimeters (mm) of the snow on each cell. This variable has numerous applications, ranging from energy planning for hydropower companies to hydrological balances for public agencies.

The maps are generated daily based on the distributed full energy balance physical model GEOtop ([Endrizzi et al., 2014](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2831/2014/gmd-7-2831-2014.html)). The model was modified to assimilate observations and satellite information with the scope of improve the results.
