## Envisat Sea Ice Thickness Product 

This dataset provides a Climate Data Record of Sea Ice Thickness for the northern hemisphere polar region, derived from the RA-2 (Radar Altimeter -2) instrument on the [Envisat](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/envisat) satellite. This product was generated in the context of the ESA Climate Change Initiative Programme ([ESA CCI](https://climate.esa.int/en/)) by the Sea Ice CCI ([Sea_Ice_cci](https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/project/sea-ice)) project.

It provides daily sea ice thickness data for the winter months of October to April annually on the satellite measurement grid (Level 2P) at the full sensor resolution for the period October 2002 to March 2012.
