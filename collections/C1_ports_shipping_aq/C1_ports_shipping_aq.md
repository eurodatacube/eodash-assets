## Ports and shipping - impact on air quality

This indicator aims at assessing ports pollution levels over the time interval 2019-2020 by correlating:
- normalized NO2 data from the TROPOMI sensor onboard Sentinel-5P satellite (daily observations)
- Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data from all the boats coming to the ports
- GNSS data (TomTom) quantifying the mean daily number of cars accessing the main street to the ports
- Anonymised cellular data (Vodafone) providing the total number of people present in the port area (2020 observations)   

This integrated analysis shows:
- **high correlation** between NO2 levels and boat traffic
- **low correlation** between NO2 levels and car traffic

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red-colored background indicates whether there were 
COVID-19 restrictions or lockdown measure in place in the country where the city is located.
