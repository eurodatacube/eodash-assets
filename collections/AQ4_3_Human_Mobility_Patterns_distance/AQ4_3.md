### Human Mobility Patterns

#### Trip distance

**Brief description:** The Trip distance displays the average total trip distance (in km) of all the trajectories that pass on a street segment during a specific hour. Higher values correspond to a significant amount of long trips passing on the street edge, whereas lower values highlight a predominance of short trips passing on the segment.

**Unit:** km

**Value Range:** 0 - 300 [km];

**Color Range:** linear scale [0, 300]


## Disclaimer

Please note that the current indicators on Human Mobility displayed on the platform have not
been yet validated or calibrated to match the real-world scenario. The estimates presented are
intended as placeholders to provide an overview of what the final platform will offer. It is
essential to keep in mind that the estimates are based on data obtained from mobile devices
and, therefore, are susceptible to biases and limitations. For instance, not everyone owns a
mobile device with location-tracking capabilities, which can impact the accuracy and
representativeness of the data. Furthermore, location-based data only cover a small percentage
of the population, which requires the implementation of statistical aggregations and averaging
techniques. As a result, the detection of extreme events (e.g., severe traffic congestion), may be
limited in the output of the analyses.

In summary, while the population presence and human mobility predictions derived from
location-based data can provide valuable insights into human behaviour, they should be used
with caution when drawing conclusions about people's mobility patterns. Specifically, predictions
may not always be accurate, and as such, should be interpreted as an approximation rather
than an exact representation of reality. Anyhow, despite their limitations, population presence
and human mobility predictions can still provide valuable insights into trends and patterns that
can support a comprehensive understanding of human behaviour.
