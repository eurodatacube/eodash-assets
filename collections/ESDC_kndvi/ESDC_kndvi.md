# Kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index

MODIS/Terra+Aqua BRDF/Albedo Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance Daily L3 Global 0.05 Deg CMG and Vegetation Indices

The kNDVI is a nonlinear generalization of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). 

Vegetation indices are derived from spectral reflectance data and are widely used in remote sensing of the biosphere, as they represent robust proxies for canopy structure, leaf pigment content, and, subsequently, plant photosynthetic potential.
