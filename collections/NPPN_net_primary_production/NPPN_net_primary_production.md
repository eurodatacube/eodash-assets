## Ocean Net Primary Production (MODIS)

The diversity of life on Earth is astonishing, yet most of the ecosystems you and I are familiar with share a common dependence on a miraculous process called photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis uses the energy in sunlight to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic material.
Aquatic and terrestrial photosynthetic plants use some of their newly formed carbon products immediately for energy and maintenance.
The remaining photosynthetic products are available for plant growth or consumption by the heterotrophic community.
We refer to this "available" carbon as net primary production, and it is equal to gross photosynthetic carbon fixation minus the carbon respired to support maintenance requirements of the whole plant.

Total net primary production on Earth exceeds 100 billion tons of carbon per year, and it plays a profound role in the global carbon cycle.
Many people are surprised to learn, however, that roughly half of this productivity occurs in the oceans and is conducted by microscopic plants called phytoplankton.
While estimates of ocean productivity have been made for decades, it wasn't until ocean-observing satellites were launched that we truly gained adequate global coverage
in space and time of phytoplankton populations to make reasonable estimates of ocean net primary production.
