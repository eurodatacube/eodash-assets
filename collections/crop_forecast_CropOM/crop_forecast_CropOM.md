The DDC (Dynamic Data Cube) Crop Model API is a web-based implementation of the state-of-the-art crop modelling algorithm, [AquaCrop](https://www.fao.org/aquacrop/en/), created by FAO.
Crop Model API model measures the actual crop development instead of purely modelling it. Combining crop development time series, high-precision meteorological data, and soil conditions from DDC with the modelling processes of AquaCrop results in a precise crop model specific to a location.

The API takes location, crop type, crop variety, sowing date, and irrigation water application data as user inputs, HR-VPP data from [Copernicus Land Services](https://land.copernicus.eu/en), Meteorological and Soil data from DDC data sources, and retrieves daily crop development (phenology), biomass, water need, and predicted yield data.
