## Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (from OCO-2)

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas primarily emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Scientists widely agree that the build-up of excess carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases within Earth’s atmosphere has contributed to the rapid change in global climate.

Unlike satellite-derived NO2 measurements, which are captured continuously on a daily basis, the coverage of CO2 measurements from OCO-2 and GOSAT is not as dense. Because of this, measurements from OCO-2 and GOSAT collected over weeks to months must be combined to yield high-resolution global maps of CO2. In addition, in order to account for long-range transport of CO2 by the wind, the data must further be assimilated into atmospheric transport models like those used to predict the weather.

The NASA dashboard uses NASA’s Global Earth Observing System Constituent Data Assimilation System (GEOS CoDAS) developed by GMAO to ingest the OCO-2 data and produce gap-filled maps.
