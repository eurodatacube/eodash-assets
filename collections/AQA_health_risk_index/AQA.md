The Aggregate Risk Index (ARI) is an index that provides a measure of the health outcome-specific risk due to the short-term exposure to multiple air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3). It is derived by additively summing the product of pollutant concentration weighted using health outcome-specific Relative Risk factors of increased mortality due to all causes, provided by the World Health Organization. The values displayed on the platform represent the geographical mean values of the daily average for each Local Administrative Unit (LAU)
