## Vessel density for non tanker or cargo

This indicator aims at showing maps representing the total ship presence time on a 1 km grid (EEA/Inspire standards)
for every month from 2017-2021 (ship categories do not include tanker and cargo ships).

The total ship presence times are converted to average instantaneous number of ships per square km.
