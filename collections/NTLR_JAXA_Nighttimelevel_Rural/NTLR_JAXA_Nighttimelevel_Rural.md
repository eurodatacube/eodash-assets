# NTLR JAXA Nighttime Light Rural
This dataset, NTLR (Nighttime Light Rural), provides a comprehensive 
global spatial representation of nighttime light levels in **rural areas**. 
It is derived from satellite observations from the [Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/viirs) 
sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. 
This dataset is valuable for studying the distribution of artificial lighting in rural regions, offering insights into human activity, infrastructure development, and rural electrification.

## Dataset description
- The dataset covers rural areas globally, highlighting nighttime light levels to analyze rural development, access to electricity, and socio-economic activities.
- Metric: Nighttime radiance values (measured in nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian, nW/cmÂ²/sr), which represent the brightness of artificial lighting in rural areas. From this can be generated  
the Nighttime Light Intensity (NTLI), a composite observations reflecting the overall intensity of visible nighttime lights in rural landscapes.
- Temporal coverage includes multi-year data, enabling trend analysis in rural electrification, infrastructure changes, and energy use patterns over time.

The dataset was developed by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) to support global research on rural development, infrastructure expansion, and socio-economic impacts in less urbanized areas. The data from VIIRS, onboard the Suomi NPP satellite, provides consistent, high-quality nighttime light data for rural regions worldwide.
