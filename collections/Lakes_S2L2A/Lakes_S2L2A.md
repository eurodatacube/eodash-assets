# Sentinel-2 Level 2A

## Dataset Description
 
Sentinel-2 Level 2A (L2A) data are atmospherically corrected Surface Reflectances in cartographic geometry. They are available from September 2016 over wider Europe region and globally since January 2017.

The [Copernicus SENTINEL-2 mission](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2) comprises a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites placed in the same sun-synchronous orbit, phased at 180Â° to each other. The constellation monitors variability in land surface conditions. 

It has a wide swath width of 290 km. Its high revisit time of 10 days with 1 satellite and 5 days with 2 satellites (at the equator) under cloud-free conditions results in 2-3 days revisit at mid-latitudes, which makes it suitable for  monitoring Earth's surface changes, including those of inland water bodies:
