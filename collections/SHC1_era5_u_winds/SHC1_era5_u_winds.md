# SHC1 ERA5 U Winds
This dataset, provides global spatial and temporal information on **zonal (east-west)** wind components at various atmospheric levels.
The **U component of wind**, also known as the **zonal wind component**, represents the east-west direction of wind movement. It measures the velocity of the wind in the horizontal plane, where the positive values indicate winds blowing from the west to the east (easterly winds), and negative values indicate winds blowing from the east to the west (westerly winds). This component is crucial for understanding the overall wind patterns and atmospheric circulation. It helps in analyzing weather systems, ocean currents, and climate variations by providing insights into the horizontal flow of air across the globe.


## Dataset description
- Metric: Zonal wind component (U component), measured in meters per second (m/s), representing the east-west component of wind speed at various pressure levels in the atmosphere.
- Temporal coverage includes historical data as well as real-time updates, allowing for both historical trend analysis and current weather monitoring.


The dataset is developed by the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/) 
 as part of the [ERA5 reanalysis project](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5), providing high-resolution, accurate wind data for global weather and climate research.
