# Temporal Interpolation of Satellite Data for Tracking Hunga Volcano Eruption Plume (SAOD)
This dataset focuses on the application of temporal interpolation techniques to monitor the plume generated by the Hunga volcano eruption in January 2022. The dataset tracks sulfate aerosols and their optical depth (SAOD) to efficiently map the plume's movement and radiative impact on the climate system, especially its effect on global temperatures.

## Dataset Description
Event: Hunga volcano eruption, January 15, 2022, 4:15 UTC. Plume reached 58 km in height within 30 minutes, injecting 0.4–0.5 Tg of SO₂ and a significant amount of water vapor into the stratosphere.
- Objective: Use temporal interpolation to address gaps in satellite data, enabling accurate tracking of sulfate aerosols within the plume.
- Metrics: Sulfate Aerosol Optical Depth (SAOD), interpolated over missing time intervals.
- Data Sources:
IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer)
AMSU (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit)
MHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder)
- Data Product: SAOD produced by RAL (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory), capturing aerosol properties in the plume.
- Research Methodology:
Data Selection: Consecutive time series data from before, during, and after the eruption are selected for plume tracking.
Gap Introduction: Simulated temporal gaps of varying lengths are randomly introduced to assess interpolation accuracy.
Interpolation Techniques: Linear regression and second-degree polynomial (incomplete) regression are applied to fill in the temporal gaps.
- Comparison & Analysis: Different methods are compared for efficiency, and new maps of SAOD are generated to visualize the results.
- Purpose:
To provide accurate spatiotemporal mapping of the Hunga eruption's aerosol plume, highlighting the evolution of the sulfate aerosols and compensating for gaps in satellite coverage using interpolation methods. The final dataset aims to offer insights into the plume's radiative impact and help predict future climatic influences of such volcanic events.
