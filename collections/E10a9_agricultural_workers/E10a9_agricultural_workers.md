## Agricultural workers

This indicator aims at showing the tomato fields preparation and crop harvesting activities in the Apulia Region (Province of Foggia - Italy) by combining:

###
1. Satellite information consisting of optical high resolution (HR, Sentinel-2, 2019 and 2020) and very high resolution (VHR, Deimos, 2020) data, which have been used to assess time evolution of vegetation indexes and perform textural analysis to identify and classify agricultural fields.
2. Anonymised mobile data (Vodafone - Italy) providing aggregated information on the number of workers in the fields belonging to 3 categories 
      - National Workers = aggregates Italian workers living in the area where they work, as well as commuting to work
      - Foreginer Workers = aggregates foreigner workers that live in the area of work, commute to work, and have Italian or foreign SIM
      - Unknown = workers of unknown nationality, that either live in the area of work or commute to work
3. [Land cover classification map from the Apulia region](http://www.sit.puglia.it/portal/portale_cartografie_tecniche_tematiche/Download/Cartografie)(last update: 2011) has been used as baseline for Vodafone cells classification.
