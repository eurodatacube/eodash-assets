## Nightlights

Nightlights data are collected by the Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) on the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) platform, a joint National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA satellite. The images are produced by NASA’s Black Marble products suite. All data are calibrated daily, corrected, and validated with ground measurements for science-ready analysis. 

The High Definition Nightlights dataset is processed to eliminate light sources like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. The darker shades are places with less light while the lighter shades of yellow are areas with more light.
