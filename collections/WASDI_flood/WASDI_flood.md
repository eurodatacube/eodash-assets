# Flood mapping 
The Flood Mapping dataset supports the analysis and visualization of flood events using advanced algorithms and satellite imagery. This dataset integrates data from multiple sources, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and VIIRS, offering comprehensive tools for detecting and monitoring floods in both open and urban areas. 

## Dataset Description
- Coverage: Global, focusing on flood-prone areas in both open landscapes and urban environments. Algorithms leverage data from the Sentinel missions and VIIRS to ensure diverse spatial and environmental coverage.
- Metric: Flood extent and intensity derived from spatial grids and imagery analysis, with temporal layering for tracking flood evolution.
- Flood Monitoring in Open Areas: Applications like Automatic S1-S2 Floods provide real-time and cumulative flood maps for non-urban landscapes, supporting environmental monitoring and emergency response.
- Urban Flood Mapping: VIIRS-based algorithms enable precise flood detection in densely populated areas.
