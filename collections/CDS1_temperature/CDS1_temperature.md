## Global temperature 

This indicator shows the air temperature at 2m above the surface of land, sea and inland waters. 
2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. 
 
**Note**
This indicator is expressed in kelvin (K). 
Conversion to degrees Celsius (Â°C) can be done by subtracting 273.15.
