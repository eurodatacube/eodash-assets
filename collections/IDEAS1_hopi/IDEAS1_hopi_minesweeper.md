# HOUHPI Minesweeper Game

Get to learn about the risks of air pollution and urban heat by exploring an risk index through a minesweeper game.
Once you finish the daily location you will get information on available species in the area, as well as their endangered status and a summary of how you did with an easy to share function.

## How-to
Open fields by left clicking on them, mark them with a flag with right click.
Use the visible background information about the area to guide your exploration and uncover new fields.
Be careful not to open up a field with a mine! These fields represent areas with high biodiversity, can you flag them all correctly?
Opened fields without mines will show a number which represents the number of mines adjacent to that field, by examining the numbers of fields which share adjacent fields you can identify where potential mines are.

If finished, your score is based on the time you spend to correctly mark all high biodiversity areas, if you opened a mine field your score will be based on percentage of uncovered area.

## Heads-up
The underlying data has been derived using Earth Observation data, for more information have a look at the <a href="./?indicator=IND1_1">original indicator</a>.
