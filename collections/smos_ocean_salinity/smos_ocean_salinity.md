## Ocean Salinity

This indicator shows the distribution of salt in the global ocean acquired by the [Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/smos/description). Ocean currents are driven by temperature and salinity variations in the seawater and Understanding ocean salinity's annual and inter-annual variability are crucial in understanding the role of the ocean in the climate system. Ocean circulation is mainly driven by the water and heat flux through the atmosphere-ocean interface, but salinity is also fundamental in determining ocean density and hence thermohaline circulation. 

### Dataset description
-  Data is acquired by the sensor onboard SMOS, the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS). MRIAS creates images of radiation emitted in the microwave L-band (1.4 GHz), by measuring changes in the salinity of seawater by observing variations in the natural microwave emission coming up off the surface of the ocean.
-  The Level 2 Ocean Salinity (OS) product comprises sea surface salinity measurements geo-located in an equal-area grid system ISEA 4H9.
-  The product contains one single swath-based sea surface salinity retrieved with and without Land-Sea contamination correction, SSS anomaly based on WOA-2009 referred to Land-Sea corrected sea surface salinity, brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere and at the sea surface with their corresponding uncertainties.
-  The pixels are consolidated in a pole-to-pole product file (50 minutes of sensing time), with a maximum size of about 10MB (25MB uncompressed data) per half orbit (29 half orbits per day).
