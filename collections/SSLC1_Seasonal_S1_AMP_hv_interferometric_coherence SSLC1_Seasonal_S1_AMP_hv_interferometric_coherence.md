# Global Coherence Sentinel-1 HV

This dataset is the first-of-its-kind spatial representation of multi-seasonal, global SAR repeat-pass interferometric coherence. 
The dataset is derived from high-resolution multi-temporal repeat-pass interferometric processing of about 205,000 Sentinel-1 Single-Look-Complex (SLC) data acquired in Interferometric Wide-Swath mode (Sentinel-1 IW mode) from 1-Dec-2019 to 30-Nov-2020.



## Dataset description
The dataset covers seasonal (DJF/MAM/JJA/SON) metrics of:

- Metric: AMP 
- Median 12- repeat coherence estimates for C-band *HV* polarized data
- Local incidence and layover/shadow regions for all relative Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B orbits. Note that in the dataset filenames seasons - were referred to as *northern hemisphere seasons*, namely winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA), and fall (SON).

The dataset was developed by [Earth Big Data LLC](https://earthbigdata.com/) and [Gamma Remote Sensing AG](https://www.gamma-rs.ch/), under contract for [NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).
