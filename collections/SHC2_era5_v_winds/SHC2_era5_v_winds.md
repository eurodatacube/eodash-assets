# SHC2 ERA5 V Winds
This dataset, provides global spatial and temporal information on **meridional (north-south) wind components** at various atmospheric levels. The **V component of wind**, also known as the meridional wind component, represents the north-south direction of wind movement. It measures the velocity of the wind in the horizontal plane, where positive values indicate winds blowing from the south to the north (northerly winds), and negative values indicate winds blowing from the north to the south (southerly winds). This component is essential for understanding the vertical and horizontal distribution of wind patterns, weather systems, and climate dynamics by providing insights into the north-south flow of air.

Dataset description
- Metric: Meridional wind component (V component), measured in meters per second (m/s), representing the north-south component of wind speed at various pressure levels in the atmosphere.
- Temporal coverage includes historical data as well as real-time updates, allowing for both historical trend analysis and current weather monitoring.

The dataset is developed by the [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)](https://www.ecmwf.int/) as part of the [ERA5 reanalysis project](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5), providing high-resolution, accurate wind data for global weather and climate research.
