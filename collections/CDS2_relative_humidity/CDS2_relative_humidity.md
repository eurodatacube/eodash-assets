## Relative humidity 

This indicator aims at showing the relative humidity of the Earth. 
The relative humidity is calculated by combining the humidity of the air with temperature and pressure.
 
**Note**
The humidity is measured by the 2m dewpoint temperature, the temperature to which the air, at 2m above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur.
