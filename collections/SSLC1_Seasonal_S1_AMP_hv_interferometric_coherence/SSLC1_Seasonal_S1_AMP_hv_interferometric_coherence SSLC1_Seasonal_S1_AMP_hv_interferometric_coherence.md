# Global Sentinel-1 Backscatter Signature (HV Band)

This dataset is the first-of-its-kind spatial representation of multi-seasonal, global SAR repeat-pass **backscatter signature**. 
The dataset is derived from high-resolution multi-temporal repeat-pass interferometric processing of about 205,000 Sentinel-1 Single-Look-Complex (SLC) data acquired in Interferometric Wide-Swath mode (Sentinel-1 IW mode) from 1-Dec-2019 to 30-Nov-2020.



## Dataset description
- The dataset covers seasonal seasons which correspond to **northern hemisphere seasons**, namely winter (DJF), spring (MAM), summer (JJA), and fall (SON).
- Metric: Mean seasonal backscatter amplitudes γ⁰ (AMP) for C-band **HV** polarized data
- Local incidence and layover/shadow regions for all relative Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B orbits. 

The dataset was developed by [Earth Big Data LLC](https://earthbigdata.com/) and [Gamma Remote Sensing AG](https://www.gamma-rs.ch/), under contract for [NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).
