#### HOW TO USE THIS TOOL

Visualise the potential electric power in MWh that can be produced considering that the PV has a high performance ratio [92%] and a high efficiency [23%].

Please note:

In order to detect and calculate the potential of solar and green roofs, the most up-to-date (at the time of the project) Digital Orthophotos (DOP, with a 20 cm spatial resolution) and Digital Surface Models (DOM, with a 1 m spatial resolution) have been provided by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Regions and Water Management (BML) through the Earth Observation Data Centre GmbH (EODC).

The Geoland Basemap Orthophoto which are included in GTIF as a basemap to support visual analysis and qualitative assessment do not correspond to the same date of the arial imaging campaign mentioned above. Due to this lack of temporal correspondence between the aerial imagery, some discrepancies exist which are however not a shortcoming of the methods employed.
