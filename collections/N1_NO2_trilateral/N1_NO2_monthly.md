## Nitrogen Dioxide Monthly

Cars, trucks, power plants, and other industrial facilities emit nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a product of burning fossil fuels. Once in the air, nitrogen dioxide can aggravate respiratory conditions, especially in people with asthma, leading to an increase of symptoms and hospital admissions. Long-term exposure can lead to the development of asthma and potentially increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. Nitrogen dioxide can quickly transform into ground-level ozone, a major respiratory pollutant and one of the main ingredients of summertime smog.
