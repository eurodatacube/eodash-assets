## Nitrogen Dioxide from Sentinel-5p TROPOMI

These maps are based on collection 3 of the Sentinel-5P Nitrogen Dioxide Level-2 products (L2__NO2___), available from the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem.
The User Manual for this product can be found [here](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/documents/247904/2474726/Sentinel-5P-Level-2-Product-User-Manual-Nitrogen-Dioxide.pdf).

The Copernicus Sentinel-5P NO2 measurements were first filtered for clouds according to the recommendation in the Product Readme file (only data with a qa_value > 0.75 was used). Then the measurements are mapped on a fixed latitude-longitude grid of 8193 x 16385 pixels. The grid is turned into an EPSG:4326 geotiff file using the appropriate color scale, which is again turned into an EPSG:3857 tile map.

The maps and underlying Level-3 gridded data files were generated by [S5P-PAL](https://s5p-pal.com/). 

The Level-3 data can be downloaded from the [S5P-PAL Data Portal](https://data-portal.s5p-pal.com/).
