## Nitrogen Dioxide for Cairo (Sentinel-5p TROPOMI)

TROPOMI observes nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column density with a high resolution of 5 km. 
NO2 is an air pollution trace gas as a result of anthropogenic activities along with fossil fuel combustion such as oil refinery, power plant, steelwork and automobile transportation the same as the CO2 emission. However, NO2 reduction is processed by decomposition different from CO2 uptake.
