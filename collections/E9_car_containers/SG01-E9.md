## Mega temporary structure construction in the port of Singapore


Indicator provided by: [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) based on data provided by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) and [ESA](https://esa.int)

Earth-observing satellites have tracked activity at global ports importing and exporting cars and other shipping containers. While data indicate an overall decline in such activity at Singapore’s Tanjong Pagar and Keepel Terminals during coronavirus-related shutdowns, a large, temporary facility can be seen at the Tanjonh Pagar Terminal. This likely is to house as many as 15,000 COVID-19 patients and foreign workers. 

Researchers use combined data from PALSAR-2, which is a L-band SAR mounted on JAXA's ALOS-2, and C-band SAR mounted on the European’s Sentinel-1, at container terminal at ports importing and exporting cars and moving containers have been observed at high frequency globally and continuously in order to monitor the change.

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 


### Change in the number of new car / containers at container terminal

Temporal changes in the density of new cars and containers at the container terminal such as Tanjong Pagar Terminal in Singapore port are monitored from January to May 2020, shown in Figure 2 using Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data.

Figures 3 and 4 show car and container density-change graphs derived from time series SAR data in Tanjong Pagar Terminal and Keepel terminal area at the port of Singapore. Figure 3 shows the density of car/containers dropping from the end of April in Tanjong Pagar Terminal. A large temporary facility can be seen in the image of Tanjong Pagar Terminal. The Singapore government announced that it will potentially house as many as 15,000 COVID-19 patients and foreign workers, as the number of coronavirus cases in Singapore continues to increase.
