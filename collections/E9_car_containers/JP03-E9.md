## Change in the number of car containers at shipping terminals 

Indicator provided by: [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) based on data provided by [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/)'s PALSAR-2 L-band SAR on ALOS-2 and [ESA](https://esa.int/)'s C-band SAR on European Sentinel-1.

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 

Situated at the innermost edge of Ise Bay, which is located at the center of the Japanese Archipelago facing the Pacific Ocean, the Port of Nagoya has steadily grown since it opened for international trade on Nov. 10, 1907. The Port of Nagoya handles all types of cargo (general, container, bulk, etc.) and is the largest port in Japan in terms of total cargo throughput, reaching 197 million tons in 2018, according to the Port of Nagoya Authority. In addition, the Port of Nagoya leads in Japanese automobile exports: approximately 1.4 million completed automobiles move through there annually. 

From November 2019 to June 2020, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) ALOS-2 satellite observed the density of car containers at Shimpomachi Terminal in the port of Nagoya to monitor the condition of industrial trade. During the novel coronavirus pandemic, ALOS-2 observations show that shipments of new cars decreased. 


Figure 1 shows the difference in the containers at the Shipomachi Terminal between November 2019 (blue) and May 2020 (red).

Figure 3 shows the density of car containers in the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 image since the end of November 2019 to October 2020. The density dropped around March and has been lower until the end of August. According on the report of the Nagoya Port Customs, it was also confirmed that the amount of exports had been declining since March. We found the car density level might be slow down and bottomed in August as well as the trend might be turned around October by satellite image analysis.
