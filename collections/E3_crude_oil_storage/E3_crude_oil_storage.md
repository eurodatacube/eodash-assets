## Crude oil storage monitoring

This indicator aims at showing the storage level of crude oil tanks by means of [X-band Iceye SAR imagery](https://www.iceye.com/sar-data)*.
The storage volume can be calculated by measuring the height and perimenter of the floating tanks roof that rises and falls with the oil volume to reduce the vapor space above the liquid surface.

## The impacts of COVID-19 on oil tanks storages

Oil sector faced a sudden decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As oil prices dropped below zero for the first time in April 2020, storage tanks had never been so full.  In July, tanks were still very full. During the COVID-19 pandemic, oil storage filled up as demand for oil decreased due to reduced travels.

In particular:
