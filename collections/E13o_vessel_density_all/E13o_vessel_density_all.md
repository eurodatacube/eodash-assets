## Vessel density 

This indicator aims at showing maps representing the total ship presence time on a 1 km grid (EEA/Inspire standards)
for every month from 2017-2021, separately for 14 different ship categories.

The total ship presence times are converted to average instantaneous number of ships per square km.
