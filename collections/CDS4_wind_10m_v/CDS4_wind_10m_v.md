## Wind V Field 

This indicator aims at showing the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north,
at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth (Northward component of the 10m wind).
The product contains one single band named "windv10m" expressed in [m s-1].
This variable can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.
 
**Note**
Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary
on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that
are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.
