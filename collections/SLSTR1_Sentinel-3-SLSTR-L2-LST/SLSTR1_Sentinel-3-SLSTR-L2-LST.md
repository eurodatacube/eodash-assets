# SLSTR1 Sentinel-3 SLSTR L2 Land Surface Temperature (LST)
The SLSTR1 (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer Level 2) dataset from the Sentinel-3 mission provides high-quality land surface temperature (LST) measurements. The data is acquired by the SLSTR instrument, which is part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program. This dataset is key for monitoring land surface temperature variations and has broad applications in climate studies, environmental monitoring, and land management.

The SLSTR instrument aboard Sentinel-3 provides enhanced global monitoring with dual-view observations and multiple thermal infrared channels to ensure precise and accurate LST measurements. The data is processed to Level-2 (L2), meaning it has undergone corrections for atmospheric interference and is ready for use in scientific and operational applications.

## Dataset Description
- Coverage: Global, covering all continents and biomes. Sentinel-3's polar orbit ensures near-complete Earth coverage, with day and night observations.
- Metric: Land Surface Temperature (LST) data with a spatial resolution of 1 km.
- Temporal Coverage: Continuous data since 2016, with a revisit time of 1-2 days due to the Sentinel-3 twin satellite constellation (Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B).
- Data Features: Dual-view (nadir and oblique) observations provide a more accurate estimate of surface temperature, especially in regions with complex topography. The dataset also includes atmospheric corrections for factors like water vapor and aerosols.

The dataset is a product of the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/) and the [Copernicus Program](https://www.copernicus.eu/en).
