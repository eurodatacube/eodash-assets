## Steel inventory timeseries

This indicator aims at showing steel inventory levels at different production plants by means of Sentinel-1 data.
Steelmaking monitoring is strategic in terms of supply of its inputs (iron ore and coal) and demand from different industries (automotive, construction).

This steel products output inventory levels indicator is produced by Aerospacelab for 9 sites in Europe. 
By defining the output zone for each steel plant and monitoring the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) backscatter signals based on Sentinel-1 data, Aerospacelab generates time series of inventory levels. 
Areas holding various forms of steel products (Coil, plate, section...) are considered in the analysis.
