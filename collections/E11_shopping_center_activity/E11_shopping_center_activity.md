## Customer Parking Occupancy

This indicator describes the occupancy of customer parking areas based on information provided by Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Copernicus Sentinel-2. The indicator is presented differently depending on the informaiton source:

- When the indicator is computed from Sentinel-1 data, the information is presented as "percentage of occupancy of customer parking" and represents the area detected as occupied (typically by cars) relative to the total parking area, at a given date.
- When the indicator is computed from Sentinel-2 data, the information is presented as "number of parked cars" and represents the absolute number of cars detectable in the Sentinel-2 image at a given date.
