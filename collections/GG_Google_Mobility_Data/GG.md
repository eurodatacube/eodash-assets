On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 

Each datasets shows the daily variation of visits and length of stay at different places compared to a baseline value - "the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020". Google makes the data available for download as CSV and presents the data as pdfs, one for each country (and art sub-national level for a number of countries). 

Here the data is presented as interactive charts to make it easier to inspect changes at country levels, browse through time, and to relate the information with the local measures taken by the authorities.

The data covers 6 place categories:

- **Grocery & pharmacy** = Mobility trends for places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.

- **Parks** = Mobility trends for places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens.

Google indicates this data should not be used for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes, nor is it intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans. The company advises users to take caution in interpreting the data, due to the large diferences in location accuracy and local characteristics that may arise from country to country. Insights are calculated based on data from users who have opted-in to Location History for their Google Account, so the data represents a sample of our users, and may or may not represent the exact behavior of a wider population.
