## Intermediate goods production

This indicator illustrates the level of intermediate goods production (steel mills/other metal, cement, chemicals/plastics) at various industrial sites by means of very high resolution optical imagery.
The indicator is based on the assessment of relevant areas at production sites, such as employee car park (full/empty), exhaust plumes (steam etc), thermal signature (furnace heat, cooling water etc). The status of the area is assessed based n very high resolution optical imagery and is compared to a baseline (for example the situation in the same month one year before).

Below is an example of car detection for estimating occupancy and activity status related to the site.
