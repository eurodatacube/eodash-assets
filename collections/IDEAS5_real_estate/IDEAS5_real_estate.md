Includes the following layers:

- **DPE / LST**: sub-layers of the indicator, representing the combination of data on
population age, social status, and building insulation (or LST depending on the file).
- **Real Estate**: the intersection of these two sub-layers. It highlights areas where the
classifications match in both sub-layers.

For data interpretation, the values range from 1 to 6, with 6 representing the highest-risk
areas, characterized by poor insulation or LST and a vulnerable population (elderly and
economically disadvantaged).
