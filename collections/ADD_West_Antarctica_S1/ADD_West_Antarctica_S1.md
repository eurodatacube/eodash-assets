# Sentinel-1 observations of Antarctica

The Sentinel-1 Antarctica dataset provides comprehensive radar imagery of the Antarctic continent through the Copernicus Earth observation program. This dataset is particularly valuable for monitoring ice sheet dynamics, glacier movements, and environmental changes in Antarctica. The data is collected using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, which enables continuous observation regardless of weather conditions or seasonal darkness.

The Sentinel-1’s radar can operate in four modes: Interferometric Wide Swath (IW), Extra Wide Swath (EW), Wave (WV) and Stripmap (SM). The EW mode is aimed primarily for use over sea-ice, polar zones and certain maritime areas, in particular for ice, oil spill monitoring and security services. Like IW, EW mode can also be used for interferometry since it shares the same characteristics for burst synchronisation, baseline and Doppler stability.

## Dataset Description
- Sensor: C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (operating at 5.405 GHz)
- Mode: Extra Wide (EW) swath mode with TOPSAR technique
- Resolution: 20 m by 40 m spatial resolution
- Swath Width: 400 km
- Temporal coverageL continuous observations since 2014
- Data features: all-weather, day-and-night imaging capability, ideal for ice monitoring and maritime surveillance.
