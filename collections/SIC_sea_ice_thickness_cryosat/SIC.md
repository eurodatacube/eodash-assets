## CryoSat Sea Ice Thickness Product

This dataset provides a Climate Data Record of Sea Ice Thickness for the NH polar region, derived from the SIRAL (SAR Interferometer Radar ALtimeter) instrument on the CryoSat-2 satellite. This product was generated in the context of the ESA Climate Change Initiative Programme (ESA CCI) by the Sea Ice CCI ([Sea_Ice_cci](https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/project/sea-ice)) project.

It provides daily sea ice thickness data for the months October to April annually on the satellite measurement grid (Level 2P) at the full sensor resolution for the period November 2010 to April 2017.
